ArrayList
● Contiguous sequence of storage locations
● Good for random access to arbitrary items of data
● Poor performance when inserting/removing
(especially at the front)

LinkedList
● Doubly-linked sequence of nodes, each containing an item of data and two pointers
● Random access very inefficient
● Insertion/removal anywhere in list is efficient

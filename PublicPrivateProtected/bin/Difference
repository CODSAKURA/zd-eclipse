private – Only this class can access this

nothing (package) – This class + this package can access this

protected – This class + this package + subclasses can access this

public – Anything can access this

So there is a hierarchy of importance: 
– The class itself has the most access (any modifier) 
– Then other classes in this package (can be blank, public, protected) 
– Then subclasses (can be public or protected) 
– Then ‘world’ (has to be public)
